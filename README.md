# Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Naïve Bayes, SVM, ANN

This repository contains implementations of fundamental and advanced Machine Learning models using Python. Each Jupyter notebook demonstrates:
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Building
- Training and Evaluation
- Visualization of Results

The goal of this project is to provide a clear understanding of different algorithms and their practical implementation

## Implemented Models
- **Logistic Regression** – Predicts continuous values using regression.
- **Naïve Bayes** – A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – A powerful classification algorithm.
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** – A deep learning model inspired by the human brain.
